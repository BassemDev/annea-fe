## Setup ‚è≥
Please make sure you have the minimum requirements to be able to run the project. This means you already installed Node latest stable version.
Optional: You could also install Docker in case you would like to create portable image and test it in different machine.
- You can install node from here: [Download](https://nodejs.org/en) üèóÔ∏è
- You can install docker from here: [Download](https://nodejs.org/en) **(keep in mind this step is optional and no need for it for app development)**

## How to run the project ‚è≤
This a simple NPM project, this mean you just need to install the package used first, then project will be able to be started:
1. Open a new terminal.
2. Cd (ie: locate) to the path of the project root.
3. Run the following command ``npm i``. The previous command will take a bit of time to install all the packages.
4. After that , run the command ``npm start``.
If everything is fine, then a new tab will open automatically in your default browser otherwise please go to this page `http://localhost:3000`.

## Test the project üß®
The project conatain different test case of functionality and components:\
1. run the command ``npm test``
This is a test in watch mode, mean you need to interact with it in order to go to the next step. (Take a look below, please):
```
Press `a` to run all tests, or run Jest with `--watchAll`.

Watch Usage
 ‚Ä∫ Press a to run all tests.
 ‚Ä∫ Press f to run only failed tests.
 ‚Ä∫ Press q to quit watch mode.
 ‚Ä∫ Press p to filter by a filename regex pattern.
 ‚Ä∫ Press t to filter by a test name regex pattern.
 ‚Ä∫ Press Enter to trigger a test run.
```

## Developer important note üéØ
- Please keep in your mind that this project use huskies which is a pre-check before you commit and push.\
    - This is a safety to keep always the project build successful and the code style unique cross all the developers. So always keep in your mind to run the formatter before pushing.
- If you need to use a new Query or Mutation for your backend system, please do **NOT** add new api by hand, you should rather generate the schema via the command line ``npm run generateSchema``.
